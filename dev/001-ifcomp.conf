    # Rewriting: This is a basic security "sandbox", so that
    # JavaScript running within a certain game can't effect anything
    # else in the ifcomp.org domain.  Redirect requests to
    # /$GAME_ID/$PATH to a subdomain beginning with that $GAME_ID,
    # e.g. /12345/content/index.html becomes
    # https://12345.play.ifcomp.org/content/index.html Then, it proxies
    # all requests for that subdomain back to the original path,
    # sending the request directly to the Catalyst server.  (It makes
    # exceptions for /static/... and /play/... paths, which have
    # special meaning to the IFComp web app.)
